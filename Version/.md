Version/ Source control is important when your working on a project with a group of people that are constantly making changes to the code. If there isn't any version/source control no one will know what changes have been made to the particular project. Also there will be no record of these changes further complicating the matter. With version / source control each change made by each individual contributor is documented and recorded so the other members of the group can stay up to date with the project and also remain on the same page with the progress being made on the project. A lot of times there is a server that holds the document or code everyone is working on. When someone makes a change to the code it saves another version of the file and also records who made the changes when. This can be accessed by other members in the group and any changes they make will be saved in another version of the file and also recorded. This is why version / source control is important. It properly documents and records each change to a file by any particular member at any given time keeping the team members up to date and involved in the project.
